Installing Hugging Face on Linux

Hugging Face is a powerful library for natural language processing that allows you to easily implement state-of-the-art models for tasks such as text generation, question answering, and language translation. In this guide, we will show you how to install Hugging Face on a Linux machine.

Step 1: Install Python

The first step is to make sure you have Python installed on your Linux machine. You can check if Python is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

`python --version` 

If Python is not installed, you can install it by running the following command:

`sudo apt-get install python3` 

Step 2: Install pip

Once you have Python installed, you will need to install pip, which is the package installer for Python. You can check if pip is installed by running the following command:

`pip --version` 

If pip is not installed, you can install it by running the following command:

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip` 

Step 3: Install the Hugging Face library

With Python and pip installed, you can now install the Hugging Face library by running the following command:

`pip install transformers` 

This will install the latest version of the Hugging Face library and all of its dependencies.

Step 4: Test the Installation

To test the installation, open a Python interpreter by running the following command:

`python` 

Then try importing the library by running the following command:

`import transformers` 

If the import is successful, you have successfully installed the Hugging Face library on your Linux machine.

That's it! You have successfully installed the Hugging Face library on your Linux machine. You can now start using it to build powerful NLP models and perform tasks such as text generation, question answering, and language translation.

# Install Svelte

```bash
npm i
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
