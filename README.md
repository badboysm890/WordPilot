# Welcome to Word‚ù£Ô∏èPilot üöÄüìù

This project is designed to help users easily convert YouTube videos into a written blog format, complete with images and the option to export the final product to Medium, WordPress, and markdown (.md) file formats. ü§©

Using our state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, this project is able to automatically transcribe and summarize the content of a given YouTube video, and then generate a written blog post that effectively conveys the main points of the video. The final blog post will also include images and other multimedia elements that will help to enhance the user's experience and make the blog post more engaging. ü§Ø

The project is open-source and available on Github, it is easy to use and understand. To get started, simply provide the link to a YouTube video and our algorithm will take care of the rest. The blog post can be exported in a variety of formats, including Medium, WordPress, and markdown, making it easy to share and publish your content on a wide range of platforms.üíª

This project is perfect for creators, marketers, and anyone looking to easily create written content from their YouTube videos. It saves time and effort by automating the transcription and summarization process, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your content creation. 

So, start using **WordPilot** and Create high-quality blog posts from your YouTube videos in minutes!üöÄ

To use the project, please follow the instructions in the README file on GitHub.

# Installation of  ü§ó hugging-face in linux

Installing Hugging Face on Linux

Hugging Face is a powerful library for natural language processing that allows you to easily implement state-of-the-art models for tasks such as text generation, question answering, and language translation. In this guide, we will show you how to install Hugging Face on a Linux machine.

Step 1: Install Python

The first step is to make sure you have Python installed on your Linux machine. You can check if Python is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

`python --version` 

If Python is not installed, you can install it by running the following command:

`sudo apt-get install python3` 

Step 2: Install pip

Once you have Python installed, you will need to install pip, which is the package installer for Python. You can check if pip is installed by running the following command:

`pip --version` 

If pip is not installed, you can install it by running the following command:

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip` 

Step 3: Install the Hugging Face library

With Python and pip installed, you can now install the Hugging Face library by running the following command:

`pip install transformers` 

This will install the latest version of the Hugging Face library and all of its dependencies.

Step 4: Test the Installation

To test the installation, open a Python interpreter by running the following command:

`python` 

Then try importing the library by running the following command:

`import transformers` 

If the import is successful, you have successfully installed the Hugging Face library on your Linux machine.

That's it! You have successfully installed the Hugging Face library on your Linux machine. You can now start using it to build powerful NLP models and perform tasks such as text generation, question answering, and language translation.

# Install Svelte

```bash
npm i
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
